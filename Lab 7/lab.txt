I started off by setting up my Beaglebone using the Piazza post. I clicked on the START.htm file
and downloaded and installed the files the site instructed me to. I then restarted my computer.

After this, I tried to ssh into my Beaglebone using the command "sudo ssh root@192.168.7.2",
as the Piazza setup instructions said to. I entered my password for my laptop, and then set
my password using the passwd command. After this, I turned on the hotspot on my phone and 
tried to connect my Beaglebone. I first used the command "sudo connmanctl", and then entered
my password. After this, I used the following commands.

enable wifi

scan wifi

services

From here, I found that my hotspot had the following ID.

wifi_2cf7f10653b2_6950686f6e65_managed_psk

So I used the following commands to connect. 

agent on

connect wifi_2cf7f10653b2_6950686f6e65_managed_psk

From here, I entered my password to connect and
 exited the connmanctl shell using the "quit" command.

I then made sure to download/update xauth and xterm using apt-get install xauth and 
apt-get install xterm. These downloaded.

I then set up a hostname named using the following command.

hostname raj

I then used the "hostname" command and it said "raj", so I know my hostname was set up.

From here, I tried to ssh into my partner's board with user root.

His IP was 172.20.10.4, so I used the following command to ssh into his board.

ssh root@172.20.10.4

I had to ask for his password in order to get in, which worked and I was connected to his board.

After this, my partner did the same for my board. Then, I logged out and set up a user account for
my partner.

I used the following command.

useradd ray
passwd ray

I made his password "RAY". After this I used the following commands to make a home directory for him

mkdir /home/ray
chown ray /home/ray

Raymond did the same for me, and he succesfully ssh'ed into his account on my board, but using the
password. I did the same, ssh'ing into my account, which was raj@172.20.10.4 w/ password "RAJ".

From here, I began the process of ssh'ing into my partner's board without a password.

I first, from my Beaglebone, used the "ssh-keygen" command.
I decided to keep it in /root/.ssh/id_rsa, so I just pressed enter.
I decided to use no passphrase, as I'm not concerned with the security here. It output the following key.

+---[RSA 2048]----+
|   o.  ...       |
|  ..o ..o.       |
|  .. *++..       |
| .  *o+.+        |
|. .+ o .S.       |
| o. . . .        |
|  ..E            |
|   .             |
|                 |
+-----------------+

I then used the following command: ssh-copy-id raj@172.20.10.4

This copied my public key to the remote server. I then used the following commands to finish off.

eval 'ssh-agent'
ssh-add

From here, I tried to ssh onto Raymond's Beaglebone normally, using "ssh raj@172.20.10.4", and it connected
without the use of any password.

After this, I exited from my BBG, and tried ssh'ing using the -X option. However, I encountered some errors, 
and found on Piazza that the fix was for me to download/install XQuartz. I did this and restarted my computer.

After, I used this command to ssh into my BeagleBone.

ssh -X root@192.68.7.2

This time it worked succesfully with no errors or warnings. From here, I used the "ssh -X raj@172.20.10.4"
command to ssh -X into Raymond's Beaglebone. It worked succesfully without asking for my password. From 
here, I simply used the "xterm" command, and a shell window came up (which did not come up without XQuartz).
The lab is complete.
