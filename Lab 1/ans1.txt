1)

The way that one would do this would be to use man -K "word", where "word" is the word in question. For example, "man -K pipe" would search the manual pages for "pipe". I utilized "man man" to find this, and then searched the manual page for the word "search", until I came across the "man -K" command.

2)

I used the "which cp" and "which wc" commands for this, and found cp in "/usr/local/cs/bin/cp" and wc in "/usr/local/cs/bin/wc". 

3) After searching through the "find" manual, I found all such programs by using the following command:

find /usr/bin -name "?" 

We get the following commands. The descriptions are derived from the man command.

[: This command evaluates condition expressions.

w: displays information about the users currently on the machine, and their processes.  The header shows, in this order, the current time, how long the system has been running, how many users  are currently logged on, and the system load averages for the past 1, 5, and 15 minutes.

X: This is a symbolic command for XOrg, which is a full featured X server that was originally designed for UNIX and UNIX-like operating systems running on Intel x86 hardware. It now runs on a wider range of hardware and OS platforms.

4) 

After navigating to the /usr/bin directory, I utilized the "ls -l | grep emacs" command and found that emacs is shorthand for /etc/alternatives/emacs.

5) 

After using the "man chmod" command, the manual for chmod gave me the following answers. The shorthand g is symbolic for group, so g+s allows the user to set the group ID on execution. The shorthand o is symbolic for other users not in the file's group, so o-x takes away the permission to execute or search directories from users not in the file's group. 

6)

After using "man find", I searched the manual for find and found that one could use the following command to access files modified in the last 3 weeks.

find -ctime -21

7)

After using the "man find" command and searching the manual for "find", I found that I could use the following command to find the directories.

find / -type d -ctime -21

8)

First, I had to find out where the "find" command was locating, using the "which find" command. I saw that it was located in /usr/bin so I used the following command to find all symbolic links in that directory:

find /usr/bin -type l

I received the following output.

This corresponds to 193 files.

First, I changed my working directory using "cd /usr/lib". After this, I used "man ls" to browse the ls manual and found that I could use the following command to sort by time and include files starting with ".":

ls -u -lt -a

After this, I scrolled to the bottom and found the following file that is the oldest:

-rwxr-xr-x   1 root root   18692 Jan 26  2014 libgpg-error.so.0.10.0

10)

After using the command "man locale" I found that the locale command's data depends on the environment variables such as LC_CTYPE, LC_NUMERIC, etc.

11)

After entering emacs, we can search for commands using C-h a "keyword" then using the keyword "sort" to find commands with sort in the name. I found the following commands.

Buffer-menu-sort
sort-columns
sort-fields
sort-lines
sort-numeric-fields
sort-pages
sort-paragraphs
sort-regexp-fields
tabulated-list-col-sort
tabulated-list-sort

12)

After entering emacs, I used the C-h b command, switched buffers using C-x o, and then searched for "C-M-a" using the C-s search command. I found the following descriptions.

C-M-a           beginning-of-defun: Move backward to the beginning of a defun.
C-M-b           backward-sexp: Move backward across one balanced expression (sexp).
C-M-c           exit-recursive-edit: Exit from the innermost recursive edit or minibuffer.
C-M-d           down-list: Move forward down one level of parentheses.
C-M-e           end-of-defun: Move forward to next end of defun.
C-M-f           forward-sexp: Move forward across one balanced expression (sexp).
C-M-h           mark-defun: Put mark at end of this defun, point at beginning.

13)

After using the C-h b command again in emacs and searching for "C-g" using the C-s search command, I found that C-g is the command for "keyboard-quit. The function of this is to Signal a ‘quit’ condition. During execution of Lisp code, this character causes a quit directly. At top-level, as an editor command, this simply beeps.

14) 

After using the C-h b command again in emacs and searching for "yank" using the C-s search command,
I found that the "yank" function reinserts the last stretch of killed text. More precisely, it reinserts the most recent kill, which is the stretch of killed text most recently killed OR yanked.

15)

After comparing the output from using the "ls -l" command and going into emacs and using "C-x d" and switching the directory to /usr/bin, the only differences I noticed was that the dired command displayed used and available memory at the beginning, while ls did not. In addition, the dired command also appended the following two files at the beginning. 

dr-xr-xr-x.   2 root root       81920 Dec 28 13:15 .
drwxr-xr-x.  16 root root        4096 Dec  5  2016 ..

It seems that dired does not ignore entries starting with ".", almost like the "ls -l -a" command. Finally, ls listed the number of files found, while dired did not.
